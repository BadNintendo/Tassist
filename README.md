# Tassist
This module manages real-time users, Twitch chat commands, and supports modular extensions (like games or themes). It uses Socket.io for WebSocket handling and tmi.js for Twitch chat integration. New developers can build bots, manage users, and easily extend features with custom commands or modules.
