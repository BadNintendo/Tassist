### Explanation of the StickPM Real-Time User Database Management and Twitch WebSocket Bot Integration Module

This module combines several functionalities: managing users in a real-time database, responding to Twitch chat commands (bot commands), and allowing modularity for custom extensions (such as games or themes). 

It uses `Socket.io` for WebSocket management and `tmi.js` for Twitch WebSocket integration to listen to chat commands from a Twitch channel. Here's a breakdown of the different components and how a new developer can use them to build a bot, manage users, or extend the system with custom modules.

### Key Components of the Module

1. **User Management**:
   - **Dynamic User Addition**: Users can be added to an in-memory database with a timestamp. This module auto-removes users after 5 minutes.
   - **User Removal**: Users are deleted from the database automatically once their session expires (5 minutes), ensuring memory isn't unnecessarily consumed.

2. **WebSocket Handling (Socket.io)**:
   - WebSockets allow real-time interaction between a client (such as a browser or bot) and a server. This module listens for connections and specific events like adding new users or activating custom modules.
   - It provides the ability to handle multiple custom events, such as bot commands or game modules.

3. **Twitch Bot Command Integration**:
   - With the integration of `tmi.js`, this module can listen to chat commands from Twitch and perform bot-related actions.
   - Commands like `!ping` can be handled to trigger responses, making it easy to extend into a full Twitch bot system.

4. **Modular Support**:
   - The module is designed with flexibility in mind. You can add game modules, theme modules, or any kind of custom commands by extending the `handleCustomModules` function.

### Step-by-Step Guide for New Developers

#### 1. **Setting Up the Module**

   Before diving into Twitch chat or WebSocket development, you need a Node.js environment.

   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install socket.io tmi.js express
     ```

   This will install:
   - **Socket.io**: For handling real-time WebSocket connections.
   - **tmi.js**: For interacting with Twitch chat.

#### 2. **User Management**

   The module has built-in logic to manage users. Here's how you would interact with it:
   
   - **Adding a user**: When a new user joins, they are added to the `userDatabase` with a unique `ObjectId` and a timestamp. The user is automatically removed after 5 minutes.

   ```javascript
   const addUser = (username) => {
       // The function generates a unique ID, adds the user, and sets up a timer to remove them.
       // Example:
       addUser('StickPMFan123');
   };
   ```

   - **Removing a user**: You donâ€™t need to worry about manually removing users. After 5 minutes, users are automatically removed from the database to free up memory.

#### 3. **WebSocket Connection with Socket.io**

   Once you have a running HTTP or HTTPS server, you can attach Socket.io to it. Here's how the WebSocket communication works:

   - **Setting up Socket.io**:
     ```javascript
     const server = require('http').createServer();  // Or HTTPS
     setupWebSocket(server);  // Attach WebSocket to your server
     server.listen(3000);  // Listen on port 3000
     ```

   - **Handling Events**:
     - The module listens for new users connecting or sending commands.
     - Example: When a user sends a 'newUser' event from the client, they are automatically added to the database.

   - **Modular Support**: Developers can extend functionality by adding custom modules (e.g., a game or theme customization). 
     Example:
     ```javascript
     socket.on('moduleAction', (eventData) => {
         handleCustomModules(eventData);
     });
     ```

#### 4. **Twitch Bot Commands**

   To use this module for Twitch bot commands, you can connect the module to a Twitch channel using the `tmi.js` library.

   - **Example Twitch Bot Setup**:
     ```javascript
     const tmi = require('tmi.js');

     // Configure Twitch client
     const twitchClient = new tmi.Client({
         options: { debug: true },
         connection: {
             reconnect: true,
             secure: true
         },
         identity: {
             username: 'your_bot_username',
             password: 'oauth:your_oauth_token'
         },
         channels: ['your_twitch_channel']
     });

     // Connect to Twitch
     twitchClient.connect();

     // Listen for messages in chat
     twitchClient.on('message', (channel, tags, message, self) => {
         if (self) return; // Ignore bot's own messages

         if (message === '!ping') {
             twitchClient.say(channel, 'Pong!');
         }

         // Use Socket.io for interaction with WebSocket server
         // socket.emit('botCommand', { command: message });
     });
     ```

   - This setup allows you to easily handle Twitch chat commands and integrate them with the WebSocket system.

#### 5. **Extending the System with Custom Modules**

   The module is built with modularity in mind, so you can easily add custom functionalities, like games, themes, or more advanced bot commands. You simply modify the `handleCustomModules` function to trigger different actions based on the `eventData`.

   ```javascript
   const handleCustomModules = (eventData) => {
       if (eventData.module === 'gameModule') {
           console.log('Starting game module...');
           // Implement your game logic here
       }
       if (eventData.module === 'themeModule') {
           console.log('Applying theme...');
           // Implement your theme change logic here
       }
   };
   ```

### Conclusion

By following the steps above, you can set up a real-time user management system that integrates with Twitch for bot commands and extend it with custom modules for games, themes, or OBS-related tools.

This module is perfect for Twitch streamers looking to develop their own bots or for developers building interactive streaming experiences that can be extended and customized with minimal effort.
